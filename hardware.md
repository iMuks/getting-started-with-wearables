# Hardware Requirements

- Adafruit FLORA: you can use any version of the Adafruit FLORA. We used a v1 which has a mini USB port. The v2 and v3 boards have a micro USB port and an onboard NeoPixel.
- Adafruit NeoPixels: we used v2 NeoPixels.

There are various UK distributors of Adafruit products, including [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) and [The Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/).

- Battery Pack: see [powering your FLORA](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/power-your-flora) for advice on suitable voltages for powering the FLORA.
