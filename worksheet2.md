# Getting started with wearables (Part 2)

## Sewing the circuit

Now it's time to sew your FLORA and NeoPixel onto an item of clothing to make it wearable. You can sew it to anything at all from t-shirts to shoes, or even your bag! Before you sew, it is important to think about where you will position the components and where you will store your battery pack.

I chose this jacket because it has a pocket where I can store the battery pack, and a lapel for me to sew the NeoPixel onto. Some of the thread can be hidden by stitching under the lapel.
